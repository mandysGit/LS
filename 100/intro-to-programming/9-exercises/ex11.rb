# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

# https://devdocs.io/ruby~2.5/
# It's easy to follow and has nice syntax highlighting with good examples
# really easy to find instance or class methods of an Object

# https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Array.html
# has more info than devdocs, but has info that I don't really need to browse often
# such as the "Files" or "class/Module Index" column on the left
