# Exception handling is used to handle errors that may occur unpredictably
# Handle errors in a manageable and predictable way
# It catches errors and allows the program change the flow of execution 
# It allows the porgram to handle the error, either log it or report a metric on it
# If errors were not caught, the program would halt when it encounters an error and stop execution
