## Pluralize

https://launchschool.com/exercises/b91485e0

### Problem

Given the following code, use `Array#each` to print the plural of each word in `words`.

```ruby
words = 'car human elephant airplane'
```

### Expected Output

```ruby
cars
humans
elephants
airplanes
```

### Understand the Problem 

- [x] Read the problem 
- [x] Write out the problem in your **own words**

```
- Given a string of words
- output the plural of each word
requirements: use Array#each
```



### Understand the Test Cases

- [x] Read each test case carefully

There are no explicit test cases for this problem, however we should pay attention to the expected output.

We want each output to have an `s` at the end.

```ruby
cars
humans
elephants
airplanes
```



### Data Structure 

- [x] Understand the data that's given and returned in the problem

**Input:** A string of words

**Output:** print each word with an s appended to the word



### Algorithm

- [x] In plain english, write out the instructions of what you need to do

  1. Convert the string to an Array of words

  2. Iterate through the Array

  3. On each iteration:

     1. concatenate 's' to the word
     2. print out the word with 's' concatenated

     



### Algorithm - Pseudocode

- [x] Rewrite your instructions into pseudocode

1. use `String#split` to convert string to an Array of words
2. use `Array#each` to iterate over each word
   1. Use string interpolation to add an `s` at the end of the word: `"#{word}s"`
   2. call `puts` method to print out:  `"#{word}s"`

### Possible solutions:

```ruby
words.split.each do |word|
  puts "#{word}s"
end
```

```ruby
# Given the following code, use `Array#each` to print the plural of each word in `words`.

# words = 'car human elephant airplane'

# Expect Output
# cars
# humans
# elephants
# airplanes

=begin
# Problem
-Use the method each to print the plural of each word in the string for the variable words
- Convert the string to an array

# Example Test Case
- use the puts method to output the plural of each string in the array

# Data Structure 
What's the input? String
What's the output? String

# Algorithm
1. Convert the String variable words into an array.
2. Iterate over the array.
3. Concatenate the string "s" with each element when iterating over the elements in the array.
4. Print out the elements iterated over.
...
=end

# Code
words = 'car human elephant airplane'

words.split.each do |str|
  puts "#{str}s"
end

```
