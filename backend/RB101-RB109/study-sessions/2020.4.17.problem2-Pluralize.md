https://launchschool.com/exercises/b91485e0

### Problem

Given the following code, use `Array#each` to print the plural of each word in `words`.

```ruby
words = 'car human elephant airplane'
```

### Expected Output

```ruby
cars
humans
elephants
airplanes
```

### Understand the Problem 

- [x] Read the problem 
- [x] Write out the problem in your **own words**

```
- Given a string of words
- output the plural of each word
requirements: use Array#each
```



### Understand the Test Cases

- [x] Read each test case carefully

There are no explicit test cases for this problem, however we should pay attention to the expected output.

We want each output to have an `s` at the end.

```ruby
cars
humans
elephants
airplanes
```



### Data Structure 

- [x] Understand the data that's given and returned in the problem

**Input:** A string of words

**Output:** print each word with an s appended to the word



### Algorithm

- [x] In plain english, write out the instructions of what you need to do

  1. Convert the string to an Array of words

  2. Iterate through the Array

  3. On each iteration:

     1. concatenate 's' to the word
     2. print out the word with 's' concatenated

     



### Algorithm - Pseudocode

- [x] Rewrite your instructions into pseudocode

1. use `String#split` to convert string to an Array of words
2. use `Array#each` to iterate over each word
   1. Use string interpolation to add an `s` at the end of the word: `"#{word}s"`
   2. call `puts` method to print out:  `"#{word}s"`

### Possible solutions:

```ruby
words.split.each do |word|
  puts "#{word}s"
end
```
