## Problem Solving Template



#### What is the purpose? 

- Practice with: 
  - **P** - Understanding the **P**roblem
  
  - **E** - Understanding **E**xample test cases 
  
  - **D** - **D**ata structures
  
  - **A** - **A**lgorithm
  
  - We will focus on **PEDA** of the **PEDAC** process
  
  - We will **not** focus on the **C** part, which is writing out the code 
  
    

#### What will students gain from this? 

- a clear plan before writing any code
-  an intuition for abstract problem solving
- an algorithm that is language agnostic
- the importance of problem solving skills
- finding the correct syntax to code the algorithm is easy part, but coming up with the algorithm is the creative and hard part. With practice, students will develop an intuition for writng out alogrithms. 



#### Understand the **P**roblem

1. Read the problem.
2. In plain english, write out the problem in your **own words**. 
   - Write out the components of the problem.
   - Do not just copy and paste the problem statement.
   - If you cannot explain the problem in your own words, do not go to the next step.
   - You may ask the interviewer for clarification of the problem.  



#### Understand **E**xample Test Cases

3. Read each test case carefully. 

   - Read the **input** and **output** of each test case.

   - Verify that the test cases match your understanding of the problem.

   - Do **not** quickly gloss over the test cases. **Really** make an effort to understand every single case.

     

#### Data Structure

4. Understand the data that's given and returned in the problem

   - What's the input from the problem (if any)? 

   - What are you going to return?

     


#### Algorithm

5. In plain english, write out the instructions of what you need do.

   - **What** are you going to do with the input?

   - Don't skip steps, list one instruction at a time, you may include the data structure(s) included in the problem and any additional data structure(s) you're planning to use

   - Don't name what library methods/functions you want to use

   - Don't list out anything that syntax specific 

     

#### Algorithm - Pseudocode     

6. Rewrite your instructions into pseudocode
   - Explain **how** you are going to implement your algorithm.
   - Example, "Use String#chars to return an array of characters in the String. Then use Array#each to iterate over each string character of the Array..."
   - you can name library methods/functions and syntax specific stuff
