## Divided by Two

https://launchschool.com/exercises/df4ae002

### Problem

Use `Enumerable#map` to iterate over `numbers` and return an array containing each number divided by 2. Assign the returned array to a variable named `half_numbers` and print its value using `#p`.

```ruby
numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}
```

### Expected output

```terminal
[50, 25, 5]
```

### Understand the Problem 

- [x] Read the problem 
- [x] Write out the problem in your **own words**

```
- Given a Hash
- use #map to iterate over each key and value pair of the hash
- Return an Array, half_numbers, with each value of the hash divided by 2
- Print each element of the array using #p
```



### Understand the Test Cases

- [x] Read each test case carefully

There are no explicit test cases for this problem, however we should pay attention to the expected output of `half_numbers`.

```ruby
[50, 25, 5]
```



### Data Structure 

- [x] Understand the data that's given and returned in the problem

**Input:** Hash

**Output:** print  `half_numbers` array



### Algorithm

- [x] In plain english, write out the instructions of what you need to do

  1. Iterate over each Hash element

  2. On each iteration

     1. do nothing with the key value
     2. divide each Hash value by 2
     3. return the value that's divided by 2

  3. Store the return value of the iteration into `half_numbers` variable

  4. print out `half_numbers` array

     



### Algorithm - Pseudocode

- [x] Rewrite your instructions into pseudocode

```
1. INITIALIZE hash_numbers = return value of map
2. ITERATE over `numbers` using `map`
		- on each iteration: value / 2
3. PRINT hash_numbers
```



### Possible solutions:

```ruby
numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

half_numbers = numbers.map do |_, value|
  value / 2
end

p half_numbers
```

**Solution from Study Session Friday May 1, 2020**
```ruby
=begin
Problem
- given a hash 'numbers'
- iterate over this hash using Enumerable#map, return an array
- the array should contain each number divided by 2
- array should be assigned to variable half_numbers
- print its value using p

- iterate over the has keys
- divide each value by two
- return all the values to array

Example Test Cases
- [50, 25, 5]

Data Structure
What's the input? hash "numbers"
What's the output? array "half_numbers"

Algorithm (List the steps in English)
1. Given a hash
2. iterate over the hash use #map. On each iteration:
  a. divide each value by 2 
3. assign return to half_numbers
4. print half_numbers using #p

=end

# Code
numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

p half_numbers = numbers.map { |_, v| v / 2 }
```
