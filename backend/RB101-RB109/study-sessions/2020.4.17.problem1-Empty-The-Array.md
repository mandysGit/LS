## Empty the Array

https://launchschool.com/exercises/0866fdc7

### Problem

Given the array below, use `loop` to remove and print each name. Stop the loop once `names` doesn't contain any more elements.

```ruby
names = ['Sally', 'Joe', 'Lisa', 'Henry']
```

Keep in mind to only use `loop`, not `while`, `until`, etc.

### Understand the Problem 

- [x] Read the problem 
- [x] Write out the problem in your **own words**

```
- Given an array with four String elements
- use `loop` to remove and print each string element
- break out of the loop when the array is empty
```



### Understand the Test Cases

- [x] Read each test case carefully


There are no explicit test cases for this problem, however we should pay attention to: 

- The `names` array should be empty when we break out of the loop

- We should see each name printed out as output



### Data Structure 

- [x] Understand the data that's given and returned in the problem

**Input:** an Array with four String elements

**Output:** each of the string elements in the array being printed



### Algorithm

- [x] In plain english, write out the instructions of what you need to do
  1. Create a loop
  2. On each iteration of the loop
     1. print one of the elements of the array
     2. remove that element from the array
  3. When the names array is empty, the loop is finished



### Algorithm - Pseudocode

- [x] Rewrite your instructions into pseudocode

1. use `Kernel#loop` to create a loop
2. On each iteration of the loop
   1.  use `puts` to print out the first element `names[0]`
   2. delete the first element: `names.delete_at(0)`
   3. use `Array#empty?` to check if names array is empty
   4. If names is empty, break out of the loop



### Possible solutions:

```ruby
names = ['Sally', 'Joe', 'Lisa', 'Henry']

loop do
  puts names[0]
  names.delete_at(0)
  break if names.empty?
end

```



```ruby
names = ['Sally', 'Joe', 'Lisa', 'Henry']

loop do
  puts names.delete_at(0)
  break if names == []
end
```



```ruby
names = ['Sally', 'Joe', 'Lisa', 'Henry']

loop do
  puts names.first
  names.delete(names.first)
  break if names == []
end
```



```ruby
# Solution from study session April 17, 2020
names = ['Sally', 'Joe', 'Lisa', 'Henry']

loop do 
  name = names.shift
  puts name
  break if names == []
end
```
